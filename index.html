          Hello and welcome potential employers! My name is Bill Kamberos and I
          want to start by thanking you for visiting my portfolio web page. I'm
          very excited for you to explore and experience all of projects and
          knowledge I have to offer. Before you dive in though, please take a
          minute to read about what lead me here.
        </p>

        <p>
          My story begins as a young, nerdy, twelve year old. My mother needed a
          computer to write papers and complete assignments for her college
          degree. After purchasing one, I soon discovered that not only can this
          computer can do office type work, but it can also be used for media
          and gaming. Flash forward a few years and I'm building my first PC
          with my friends and learning everything about current PC hardware.
        </p>

          After high school I wanted to turn my love of computers into a career.
          I realized quickly that I enjoyed more of a creative approach to
          technology instead of the hardware/industrial aspect. Which led me to
          signing up for a coding camp to really propel my career in the right
          direction. I chose UPenn's coding camp and never looked back. I am now
          confident in my abilities and ready to start a new career as a full
          stack developer!
